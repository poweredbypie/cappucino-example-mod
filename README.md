Example Cappucino Mod

# actually customizing the mod
to edit the button callback, edit `MyLayer::init` in `MyLayer.cpp`.
modifying the sprite name of the button is a bit trickier - DM me on discord lol it's a bit hard to explain (or at least, to keep clean)

# debugging your mod
to debug, open Geometry Dash, start debugging, and inject the DLL. if you have a default team installation of GD, it should work. if not, right click on the solution, go to debugging, and edit the "command" field to be the path to your GeometryDash.exe.
